abstract = {Decision tree pruning techniques and other forms of overfitting avoidance have often been considered statistical means of improving predictive accuracy. Intuitively, they are intended to determine the appropriate level of complexity for an induced model by distinguishing between signal and noise in training data, patterns that reflect the true underlying nature of data generation and those that arise by chance. In fact, however, overfitting avoidance methods simply encode preferences for certain classes of models. These preferences may increase accuracy when they bias induction in favor of predictive models, but they may just as well have the opposite effect if they bias induction away from predictive models. This paper analyzes the conditional value of overfitting avoidance and focuses on the effect of one highly-regarded pruning technique in variations of the well-known digit recognition problem.}

abstract = {Decision tree classification algorithms have significant potential for land cover mapping problems and have not been tested in detail by the remote sensing community relative to more conventional pattern recognition techniques such as maximum likelihood classification. In this paper, we present several types of decision tree classification algorithms arid evaluate them on three different remote sensing data sets. The decision tree classification algorithms tested include an univariate decision tree, a multivariate decision tree, and a hybrid decision tree capable of including several different types of classification algorithms within a single decision tree structure. Classification accuracies produced by each of these decision tree algorithms are compared with both maximum likelihood and linear discriminant function classifiers. Results from this analysis show that the decision tree algorithms consistently outperform the maximum likelihood and linear discriminant function classifiers in regard to classf — cation accuracy. In particular, the hybrid tree consistently produced the highest classification accuracies for the data sets tested. More generally, the results from this work show that decision trees have several advantages for remote sensing applications by virtue of their relatively simple, explicit, and intuitive classification structure. Further, decision tree algorithms are strictly nonparametric and, therefore, make no assumptions regarding the distribution of input data, and are flexible and robust with respect to nonlinear and noisy relations among input features and class labels.}

abstract="Univariate decision trees (UDT's) have inherent problems of replication, repetition, and fragmentation. Multivariate decision trees (MDT's) have been proposed to overcome some of the problems. Close examination of the conventional ways of building MDT's, however, reveals that the fragmentation problem still persists. A novel approach is suggested to minimize the fragmentation problem by separating hyperplane search from decision tree building. This is achieved by feature transformation. Let the initial feature vector be x, the new feature vector after feature transformation T is y, i.e., y = T(x). We can obtain an MDTb y (1) building a UDT on y; and (2) replacing new features y at each node with the combinations of initial features x. We elaborate on the advantages of this approach, the details of T, and why it is expected to perform well. Experiments are conducted in order to confirm the analysis, and results are compared to those of C4.5, OC1, and CART",

abstract = {In recent years, an enormous amount of research has been carried out on support vector machines (SVMs) and their application in several fields of science. SVMs are one of the most powerful and robust classification and regression algorithms in multiple fields of application. The SVM has been playing a significant role in pattern recognition which is an extensively popular and active research area among the researchers. Research in some fields where SVMs do not perform well has spurred development of other applications such as SVM for large data sets, SVM for multi classification and SVM for unbalanced data sets. Further, SVM has been integrated with other advanced methods such as evolve algorithms, to enhance the ability of classification and optimize parameters. SVM algorithms have gained recognition in research and applications in several scientific and engineering areas. This paper provides a brief introduction of SVMs, describes many applications and summarizes challenges and trends. Furthermore, limitations of SVMs will be identified. The future of SVMs will be discussed in conjunction with further applications. The applications of SVMs will be reviewed as well, especially in the some fields.}

abstract = {Random Forest is an ensemble of decision trees based on the bagging and random subspace concepts. As suggested by Breiman, the strength of unstable learners and the diversity among them are the ensemble models’ core strength. In this paper, we propose two approaches known as oblique and rotation double random forests. In the first approach, we propose rotation based double random forest. In rotation based double random forests, transformation or rotation of the feature space is generated at each node. At each node different random feature subspace is chosen for evaluation, hence the transformation at each node is different. Different transformations result in better diversity among the base learners and hence, better generalization performance. With the double random forest as base learner, the data at each node is transformed via two different transformations namely, principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis. In the second approach, we propose oblique double random forest. Decision trees in random forest and double random forest are univariate, and this results in the generation of axis parallel split which fails to capture the geometric structure of the data. Also, the standard random forest may not grow sufficiently large decision trees resulting in suboptimal performance. To capture the geometric properties and to grow the decision trees of sufficient depth, we propose oblique double random forest. The oblique double random forest models are multivariate decision trees. At each non-leaf node, multisurface proximal support vector machine generates the optimal plane for better generalization performance. Also, different regularization techniques (Tikhonov regularization, axis-parallel split regularization, Null space regularization) are employed for tackling the small sample size problems in the decision trees of oblique double random forest. The proposed ensembles of decision trees produce trees with bigger size compared to the standard ensembles of decision trees as bagging is used at each non-leaf node which results in improved performance. The evaluation of the baseline models and the proposed oblique and rotation double random forest models is performed on benchmark 121 UCI datasets and real-world fisheries datasets. Both statistical analysis and the experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed oblique and rotation double random forest models compared to the baseline models on the benchmark datasets.}

abstract = {We propose ODTE, a new ensemble that uses oblique decision trees as base classifiers. Additionally, we introduce STree, the base algorithm for growing oblique decision trees, which leverages support vector machines to define hyperplanes within the decision nodes. We embed a multiclass strategy (one-vs-one or one-vs-rest) at the decision nodes, allowing the model to directly handle non-binary classification tasks without the need to cluster instances into two groups, as is common in other approaches from the literature. In each decision node, only the best-performing model (SVM)—the one that minimizes an impurity measure for the n-ary classification—is retained, even if the learned SVM addresses a binary classification subtask. An extensive experimental study involving 49 datasets and various state-of-the-art algorithms for oblique decision tree ensembles has been conducted. Our results show that ODTE ranks consistently above its competitors, achieving significant performance gains when hyperparameters are carefully tuned. Moreover, the oblique decision trees learned through STree are more compact than those produced by other algorithms evaluated in our experiments.}

abstract = {Decision tree pruning techniques and other forms of overfitting avoidance have often been considered statistical means of improving predictive accuracy. Intuitively, they are intended to determine the appropriate level of complexity for an induced model by distinguishing between signal and noise in training data, patterns that reflect the true underlying nature of data generation and those that arise by chance. In fact, however, overfitting avoidance methods simply encode preferences for certain classes of models. These preferences may increase accuracy when they bias induction in favor of predictive models, but they may just as well have the opposite effect if they bias induction away from predictive models. This paper analyzes the conditional value of overfitting avoidance and focuses on the effect of one highly-regarded pruning technique in variations of the well-known digit recognition problem.}

abstract = {Decision tree classification algorithms have significant potential for land cover mapping problems and have not been tested in detail by the remote sensing community relative to more conventional pattern recognition techniques such as maximum likelihood classification. In this paper, we present several types of decision tree classification algorithms arid evaluate them on three different remote sensing data sets. The decision tree classification algorithms tested include an univariate decision tree, a multivariate decision tree, and a hybrid decision tree capable of including several different types of classification algorithms within a single decision tree structure. Classification accuracies produced by each of these decision tree algorithms are compared with both maximum likelihood and linear discriminant function classifiers. Results from this analysis show that the decision tree algorithms consistently outperform the maximum likelihood and linear discriminant function classifiers in regard to classf — cation accuracy. In particular, the hybrid tree consistently produced the highest classification accuracies for the data sets tested. More generally, the results from this work show that decision trees have several advantages for remote sensing applications by virtue of their relatively simple, explicit, and intuitive classification structure. Further, decision tree algorithms are strictly nonparametric and, therefore, make no assumptions regarding the distribution of input data, and are flexible and robust with respect to nonlinear and noisy relations among input features and class labels.}

abstract="Univariate decision trees (UDT's) have inherent problems of replication, repetition, and fragmentation. Multivariate decision trees (MDT's) have been proposed to overcome some of the problems. Close examination of the conventional ways of building MDT's, however, reveals that the fragmentation problem still persists. A novel approach is suggested to minimize the fragmentation problem by separating hyperplane search from decision tree building. This is achieved by feature transformation. Let the initial feature vector be x, the new feature vector after feature transformation T is y, i.e., y = T(x). We can obtain an MDTb y (1) building a UDT on y; and (2) replacing new features y at each node with the combinations of initial features x. We elaborate on the advantages of this approach, the details of T, and why it is expected to perform well. Experiments are conducted in order to confirm the analysis, and results are compared to those of C4.5, OC1, and CART",

## Decision Trees

Decision Trees (DTs) are interpretable classification models that represent their decision-making process through a hierarchical, tree-like structure. This structure comprises internal nodes containing splitting criteria and terminal (leaf) nodes corresponding to class labels. The nodes are connected by directed edges, each representing a possible outcome of a splitting criterion. Formally, a DT can be expressed as a rooted, directed tree $T = (G(V, E), v_1)$, where $V$ denotes the set of nodes, $E$ represents the set of edges linking these nodes, and $v_1$ is the root node.

If the tree $T$ has $m$ nodes, then for any $j \in \{1, \ldots, m\}$, the set of child nodes of $v_j \in V$ can be defined as:

$$
N^{+}(v_j) = \{ v_k \in V \mid k \in \{1, \ldots, m\},\; k \neq j,\; (v_j, v_k) \in E \}.
$$

Here, $N^{+}(v_j)$ denotes the set of nodes that are directly connected to $v_j$ through outgoing edges, representing all possible child nodes that can be reached from $v_j$ within the tree structure [@lopez2018]. Decision Trees can be categorized based on the type of splitting criterion applied at each node, namely **univariate (axis-parallel)** and **multivariate (oblique)** decision trees.

### Axis-Parallel Decision Trees

These trees represent axis-parallel hyperplanes dividing the instance space into several disjoint regions. Axis-parallel decision trees, such as CART and C4.5, represent two of the most widely used algorithms for classification tasks. The **CART (Classification and Regression Trees)** algorithm employs a binary recursive partitioning procedure capable of handling both continuous and categorical variables as predictors or targets. It operates directly on raw data without requiring binning. The tree is expanded recursively until no further splits are possible, after which **cost-complexity pruning** is applied to remove branches that contribute least to predictive performance. This pruning process generates a sequence of nested subtrees, from which the optimal model is selected using independent test data or cross-validation, rather than internal training measures [@breiman1984].

In contrast, **C4.5**, an extension of the earlier **ID3** algorithm, utilizes information-theoretic measures such as **information gain** and **gain ratio** to select the most informative attribute for each split [@quinlan1993]. C4.5 also includes mechanisms to handle missing attribute values by weighting instances according to the proportion of known data and employs an **error-based pruning** method to reduce overfitting. Although these techniques are effective across diverse datasets, studies have shown that the choice of pruning strategy and stopping criteria can significantly affect model performance across different domains [@mingers1989; @schaffer1992].
